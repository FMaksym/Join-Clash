# Join-Clash
A project called Join Clash is a game, the essence of which is that you need to run forward, collecting little men along the way, in order to defeat the boss at the end of the path. Along the way, a crowd of little men may encounter obstacles, as a result of which their number will decrease if they encounter obstacles. The game is the prototype of the real Join Clash game. 

I was trying to implement the basic mechanics of the game. The result can be seen at the link in the video:
